title: My Experience at Bloc
---

Growing up there in a family of carpenters, plumbers and every other construction dicipline known to man I found a love to build and create new things early in life.  Living my dream as builder I surpassed everyone in my family. I built the bigest and most ornate projects.
When the hands on aspect of my work became routing I moved found Desgin and Surveying, learning how to put my thoughts and inspirations into the projects. I learned it all, ate every bit of knowledge I could find. And then one day.... Code Academy.

I found a new way to build, new things to make. After consuming the majority of the courses at Code Academy I found Bloc. A six months later here I sit. Not in front of Auto Cad or Bim, but Cloud 9 and Brackets. Not dreaming up a plan for a home, but creating a blueprint for a rails app.
And enjoying every challenge on the way.

## Challenges

So far the biggest challenge I have faced at Bloc is not anything I can learn but myself. My life, the amount of time. Learning a new thing is never really easy. Learning it with a full time job and three children is a task in its own. If I can do it anyone can, there is nothing that sets me apart from anyone else except desire.


## Conclusion

Bloc is quick accelerating fast pased learning program that will overwelm you. Coming from my background it has been hard. At times the mentors like to tell you its like drinking from a fire hose and for the most part it is.
every mouthful you can swallow is knowledge gained and even thougth you may not realize it the puddles on the ground are stil there for you use.

I have made functioning applications, I have made webpages. But most important of all I have more tools for my tool box.
